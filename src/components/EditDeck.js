// Edit Deck
// The Edit Deck screen allows the user to modify information on an existing deck.

// The Edit Deck screen has the following features:

// The path to this screen should include the deckId (i.e., /decks/:deckId/edit).
// There is a breadcrumb navigation bar with a link to home /, followed by the name of the deck being edited, and finally the text Edit Deck (e.g., Home / React / Edit Deck).
// It displays a similar form as the Create Deck screen, except it is prefilled with information for the existing deck.
// The user can edit and update the form.
// If the user clicks Cancel, the user is taken to the Deck screen.
