// The Edit Card screen allows the user to modify information on an existing card.
// The Edit Card screen has the following features:

// The path to this screen should include the deckId and the cardId (i.e., /decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/edit).
// There is a breadcrumb navigation bar with a link to home /, followed by the name of the deck of which the edited card is a member, and finally the text Edit Card :cardId (e.g., Home / React Router / Edit Card 3).
// It displays the same form as the Add Card screen, except it is prefilled with information for the existing card. It can be edited and updated.
// If the user clicks on either Save or Cancel, the user is taken to the Deck screen.
